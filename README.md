# Water Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the quality of water using machine learning techniques. Clean and safe drinking water is essential for human health, yet contamination is a global issue. By analyzing key water quality parameters, this project predicts whether a given water sample is safe for consumption.

This project was developed as part of a virtual internship in Green AI at Edunet.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- To analyze water quality parameters and identify patterns in contaminated vs. clean water.
- To build and evaluate a machine learning model that classifies water as safe or unsafe.
- To provide an AI-driven solution for efficient water resource management and contamination detection.
